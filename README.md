# Book Review Application
  As part of this project, we will build a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at the session level using JWT. You will then test your application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.

### Features

- Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
- Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book’s ISBN code, author names and titles
- Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
- Register as a new user of the application
- Login to the application
- Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
- Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
- Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
- (Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
